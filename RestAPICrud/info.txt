When we'll start using the Entity Framework for storing the data,
we need to add the following packages,

1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
2. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools  <-- This is basically used for code migration.

Then Crete a class call EmployeeContext and inherit from DbContext

After Creating necessary data and context class run the migration command in Package Manager console for migration.

1. Add-Migration and give the name as Initial Migraition
2. Update-Database to add the actual table in the DB
